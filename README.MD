copyin https://github.com/Souler/ppsspp-adhoc-server/ to understand how adhoc works (and to maybe make a better clone?)
prolly 100% terrible
needs a lot of work
the end goal is to get a full-featured adhoc server, including
- web status page like socom.cc (its quite nice, if a bit janky because of the unfold on hover)
- proxying of connections (i dont see many people with upnp enabled nowadays)
